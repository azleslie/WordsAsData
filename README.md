## Setup for Beginners
If you’re new to R, you’ll need to set up access in one of two ways first. The standard method is to [download R itself](https://cran.rstudio.com/) for whichever operating system you're using and then [download RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that makes working in R clearer by adding a text editor for writing or loading R code and a workspace for viewing data in memory.

If you want a fast, easy way to give R a try with a stable internet connection, you can use [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/). This browser version of RStudio looks and functions just like the desktop version, and it saves data between sessions too. All it takes is a Google account to log on. You can even clone this workshop repository directly into your RStudio Cloud workspace by clicking the arrow next to the “New Project” button, selecting “New Project from Git Repo,” and then pasting the url to this page.
